Data Analytics Portfolio
A concise, reproducible showcase of analytics skills: an exploratory notebook, a Power BI template with no embedded data, and an Excel file used for structure and sample data.

Overview
This repository demonstrates an end-to-end workflow from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to an interactive dashboard. Everything is lightweight so reviewers can scan the code, run the notebook, and open the dashboard template without sensitive data.
