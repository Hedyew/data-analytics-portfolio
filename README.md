Data Analysis Final Project
This project presents a complete data analysis workflow, including data collection, storage, analysis, dashboard design, and a simple machine learning model. It was developed as the final project for a Data Analysis course.
Project Overview
The objective of this project is to demonstrate the process of handling data from end to end, starting with acquiring a dataset from a public source, managing it in a database, performing statistical analysis, creating visual dashboards, and applying a basic machine learning model.
Project Steps
Data Collection
A dataset was selected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and prepared for analysis.
Database Storage
The dataset was stored in a PostgreSQL database. Appropriate tables were created, and data was loaded into the database for further analysis.
Data Analysis
Descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were performed, including measures of central tendency, dispersion, and correlation analysis. Visualizations were created to better understand the data patterns.
Dashboard Design
A dashboard was developed and connected to the PostgreSQL database to visualize key performance indicators and analytical insights.
Machine Learning
The data was loaded into Python from PostgreSQL, preprocessed, and used to train a simple machine learning model for predictive analysis.
